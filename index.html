            <h1>About me</h1>
            <strong><small></small>How I got here</strong>
            <p>Hey, My name is Mohamed Kaid but you could just call me Moe for short. I'm currently studying Computer Science as well as Software Engineer and Simulation & Animation in Gaming. I'm currently attending a coding boot camp called Coding Temple inspiring in becoming either a Software Engineer or Developer. I've bounced around a lot from place to place which allowed me to explore different parts of the world. I'm currently seeking an internship that relates to my interest in hopes of gaining more expierence as a programmer. My ideal job is to work at a car company like Ford or Lexus and create new technologies for the world to expierence. </p>

                <p>Usually I like to play video games or watch anime nowadays. I play a wide variety of games whether it's single player or multiplayer games. Also, I like to watch a variety of anime and live action shows including reading manga or light novels (although I usually stick to manga more). Usually it's been single player games for me because multiplayer games have been lacking and dying out. I also like to go to the gym and play basketball because it's my favorite sport. On the occasion, I may do other nonregular activities however the routine has always been the same for me and I don't mind it this way. I also would like to travel whenever I get my income straight.</p>

              <p> Goals are something you'll always have on the back of your mind. It's something you'll always have self-doubt in and will continue to haunt you as you make pursuit. However like Goku in the healing chamber, they'll be times where you'll hit astray and won't know how to get back on your feet. But like Goku, with time, dedication, and pacience, you'll be the strongest warrior in the world aka be the best at your own game. What this means is that you'll have to work harder than anyone else and will have to endure a lot of pain and stress. Goku had to heal in the healing chamber becuase of the damage he suffered however when he got out, he was better than ever before and was able to save the world (Planet Namek). However with coding, you will stumble on things that will just mentally destroy you however when you think about struggle and what it takes to recover, think about Goku!
